```
This project is using "loop" to make the Amortization schedule for 10-year loan of $200000 repaid by monthly payments due at the end of each month. The annual effective interest rate charged by the loan is 3%.
```

```{r}
n <- 10
L <- 200000
i <- 0.03
monthly_rate <- (1+i)^(1/12)-1
payment_number <- 12*n
payment_size <- L/((1-(1+monthly_rate)^(-payment_number))/monthly_rate)
                   
I <- matrix(1+payment_number,0,0)
PR <- matrix(0,1+payment_number,0)
OB <- matrix(0,0,1+payment_number)
I[1] <- 0
PR[1] <- 0
OB[1] <- L

for (time in 1:payment_number){
  I[time+1] <- OB[time]*monthly_rate
  PR[time+1] <- payment_size-I[time+1]
  OB[time+1] <- OB[time]-PR[time+1]
}

amortization_table <- cbind(I,PR,OB)
rownames(amortization_table) = c(0, 1:num_payments)
colnames(amortization_table) = c("interest paid", "principle repaid", "outstanding balance")
print(amortization_table)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
